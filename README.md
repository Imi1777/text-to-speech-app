Text-to-Speech App

This is a simple text-to-speech app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users type text and hear it spoken out loud using the browser’s built-in speech feature.

What it does

- Converts text into speech

- Lets you choose different voices

- Adjust speech speed and pitch

- Shows a live character count

- Runs fully in the browser (no backend)

How to use it

- Open the app in your browser

- Type or paste your text

- Pick a voice

- Adjust the speed and pitch if you want

- Click Speak to hear it

- Click Stop to stop the speech
